## <P id='1' style="background-color:tomato" >project description<p>
project build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. We convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 

## Specification
## <P id='2' style="background-color:tomato">Specification </p>

This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.


## <P id='3' style="background-color:tomato">Behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty</li>
<li>while scrolling through the page It should be clear which section is being viewed</li>
<li>When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.</li>
<li>All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.</li>
</ul>

## <P id='4' style="background-color:tomato">Developing Tool and strategy </p>
